# epstudio
A student gallery system

Initial code started from the wonderful https://github.com/phundal/pwa-starter-flask project

start by building a python venv
(depending on your install, your command may be py or python or even python3)

py -m venv <epstudio directory> #you can use a . to indicate the directory that you are already in

then running Scripts\activate.ps1 or Scripts\activate.bat will load that environment up in the future

install the requirements from the requirements file
> pip install -r requirements.txt
> flask run
Open your browser to http://localhost:5000 to see your web app

# pwa-starter-flask reference
PWA framework built on Python3 and Flask.  Great place to start building a mobile PWA.

- Just pull this repo down, install python requirements.txt, and execute app.py.  Assuming this works cleanly, you can start to build something magical.  More details on install coming.
